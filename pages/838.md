# After 480 days uptime, lights out for old servicestack.net server

From today, after having served its 484th day of uptime we’re now relenquishing the old servicestack.net server into a well-earned retirement.

## Over 480 days uptime and 10M+ commands processed
Since its last restart it has processed more than 10+ Million redis operations resulting from ServiceStack’s Redis-powered live demos and our other websites we had that were using Redis for front-level caching.

It was a CentOS/Mono powered 2GB RAM dedicated server from leaseweb which we put to work to host the servicestack.net domain (inc. all the live demos) as well as the other side projects I had running e.g: ajaxstack.com, freelamusica.com.

Unfortunately time became its ultimate undoing, where newer spec’ed hardware and profileration of in-expensive hosting providers have now diluted its once great value.

## The big move
Fortunately moving between Linux servers is easy and we were able to transfer to a different hosting provider in 1 weekend. Configuring Nginx and Apache has gotten a lot better where both now have “no touch” virtual host configuration and simple sym-links to decide which sites should be enabled.

Transferring the GB’s of website content was done with a single rsync command that completed in minutes, thanks to both servers having blindingly fast bandwidth.

## WordPress migrations still painful on Linux
Most of the time ended up being spent on migrating this WordPress blog, where I had to manually create the new database, configure host settings, export and import the blog content and as well as hunt down and enable the website template and all the existing plugins. Its funny that despite being developed on the LAMP stack, it’s still easier to install WordPress on Windows than Linux.

## Final Memento
I’ll share details of the new server in a future post. But for now I’ll leave this final screenshot of the RedisAdmin UI info page as reminder of the little work horse that was, captured in its final hours – showing its impressive redis-server stats :)
